#' This function counts the occurrences of specified concept ids within specified tables in an OMOP database,
#' including direct occurrences and occurrences through descendants, based on a provided cdm_schema and links.
#' It returns a tibble summarizing the counts across persons and across records.
#'
#' @param v A vector of concept_ids to count occurrences for.
#' @param tables A character vector of CDM table names to search within.
#' @param links A list linking each table to its respective concept_id field.
#' @param db_connection A database connection object through which queries will be executed.
#' @param cdm_schema The database cdm_schema in which the tables are located.
#' @param vocab_schema The database vocab_schema in which the concept tables are located.
#' @param save_path The path to save the results to as a CSV file. If NULL, the results are not saved.
#'
#' @return A tibble with columns for the number of times any concept from 'v' occurs: direct count of persons,
#'         direct count of records, descendant count of persons, and descendant count of records.
#'         The tibble also includes the concept names and domain ids derived from `v` and is arranged by the total
#'         record count (direct + descendant).
