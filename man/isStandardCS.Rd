\title{Check for Non-Standard Concepts in Concept Sets}
\usage{
isStandardCS(conceptSet, save_path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{conceptSet}{An object representing a set of concepts, containing details such as concept ID, concept name, and whether it is a standard concept. The structure of this object should support `@Expression` to access the individual concepts and their properties.}

\item{save_path}{(Optional) The file path where the details of non-standard concepts should be saved as a CSV file. If not provided, the information will not be saved but will still be checked for non-standard concepts.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the columns `concept_name`, `concept_id`, `concept_set`, and `standard_concept`, which represent the concept name, concept ID, the name of the concept set, and the standard status for each concept found to be non-standard or not classified as standard.
}
\description{
This function examines a concept set for non-standard concepts by comparing them against a standard concepts table in a SQL database. It identifies non-standard concepts and optionally saves the details of these non-standard concepts to a specified path.
}
\details{
The function processes a given concept set to identify non-standard concepts. Non-standard concepts are those not marked as 'S' (Standard) or 'C' (Classification) in their `standard_concept` attribute. The function creates a data frame with concept details, replaces empty `standard_concept` values with "Non-standard", filters out standard and classification concepts, and if a `save_path` is provided, saves this information to a CSV file. If no non-standard concepts are found, appropriate messages are displayed.
